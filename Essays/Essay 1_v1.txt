The exchange’s funds are all transparently recorded on the blockchain, so they can be audited by anyone, at any time, and whilst user funds can still remain private.

OpenLedger provides a NASDAQ-grade system that enables a remarkable 100,000 transactions per second, and aggregates order books between exchanges for greater liquidity and depth than ever before. It’s the essentially the next generation in terms of execution and latency rates.
