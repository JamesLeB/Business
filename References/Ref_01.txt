FEE SCHEDULE
Listed below are the fee schedules, margin, and leverage info for the currency pairs available for trading on Kraken.

The fee schedules are tier-based: the more total volume you trade in your account, the lower your fee on subsequent trades (once the next volume tier for the currency pair is reached). Other fee considerations:

Fees are charged on a per-trade basis.
Fees are calculated as a percentage of the trade's quote currency volume (by default). Certain pairs allow the fee to be calculated based on the trade's base currency, which can be specified when ordering using the Fee Currency option.
User fee volume levels are measured using the equivalent market value of the listed "Fee Volume Currency" at the time of the trade. Note that this currency may be different from the pair's base or quote currency.
User fee volume levels are measured and applicable for trades occurring in the last 30 days only.
Additional Fees

Processing fee for paper copies of communications: $60/page
